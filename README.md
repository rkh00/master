The code I wrote for my Master's Thesis in Geomatics at the NTNU Department of Civil Engineering in the spring of 2024.

Centroid Locator is currently in development and is available [on Github Pages](https://rkh00.github.io/master/).

### TODO:

- Add area centroid
- ~~Add option to include terrain in calculation~~ nvm this is stupidly difficult
- ~~Add option to calculate population center~~ see previous
- Sh\*tload of refactotring
- Add Norway polygon?
- Add feature to show minimum bounding rectangle?
- Add conversion of coordinate systems?
